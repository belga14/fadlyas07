## Some minor info about me
I am from a lovey country Indonesia. I started my journey with Linux in 2018. Since then, I've been very interested in Linux Kernel. I've been developing linux kernels for my Android device since then. It's been a fun journey. Hope it continues.

## What are you up to now?
- Recognize this world.
- Learning C, C++, and more.
- Learning English, German, & Japanese.
- Contributing to opensource projects sometimes.
- Wandering around GitHub mindlessly.
